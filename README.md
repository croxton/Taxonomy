# Taxonomy Module for ExpressionEngine 2.0

### Overview

The Taxonomy Module is a navigation & auto breadcumb building tool which uses nested sets to control hierarchy. The class used is straight from the CI community (MPTtree) and that does most of the heavy lifting.

Unlike the Pages Module, Taxonomy uri's are built using regular template_group/url_title or template_group/template/url_title paths Ñ so for example, the uri /page/copyright/ could represent something 10 levels deep in the Taxonomy module.

The module's primary purpose is *not* to give you an overview of your entire site. Instead, it is intended for building menus/breadcrumbs for 'page' sections of your site that need hierarchy beyond simple page lists.

To get a quick overview of the module, please [checkout the screencast](http://iain.co.nz/taxonomy/taxonomy.mov).

Taxonomy also allows you to create multiple trees to handle multiple menus

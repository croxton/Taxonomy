# Taxonomy Module for ExpressionEngine 2.0

### Overview

The Taxonomy Module is a navigation/breadcrumb building tool for 'page' sections of your site. The module uses nested sets to control hierarchy and utilises the MPTtree library from the CodeIgniter community.

Taxonomy lets you build navigation trees to unlimited depths which comprise of any of the following types of links:

1. Build links in your tree which use regular template_group/url_title or template_group/template/url_title paths
2. Build links in your tree from entries using page uris from the EE Pages Module (NEW!)
3. Or enter a url override to build nodes in your tree that link to anywhere you like!

The module comes bundled with a fieldtype to allow publishers to insert menu items directly from the publish page.

To get a quick overview of the module, please [checkout the screencast](http://vimeo.com/16276505) and be sure to check out the [Quick Start Guide](http://iain.co.nz/taxonomy/quick_start/).

Taxonomy also allows you to create as many trees as you need to handle multiple menus.

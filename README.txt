ABOUT

Taxonomy creates order within your entries by allowing them to be nest entries in parent(s) child(ren) relationships.

Unlike the pages module, uri's are using regular template/url_title paths - so the path /about/legal/ could represent something 10+levels deep in a site structure.

This is an early release, tested in a narrow environment, there will be bugs and some munty code around; I'm using this to learn PHP & CI development.

Enjoy.
